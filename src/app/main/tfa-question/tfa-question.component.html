<p class="sw-redefine-pass">For security reasons we suggest you to enable Two-Factor Authentication <a href="http://www.swapynow.com/faq#2fa" target="_blank">(learn more)</a>. As soon as you enable it, you will be asked for a validation code for every sign in action. Codes can be obtained in your phone by Google Authenticator or similar app. It makes harder for an intruder to reach your account and is highly recommended.</p>
